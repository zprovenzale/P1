# CSC212Assignments [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jjfiv/CSC212Assignments.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jjfiv/CSC212Assignments)
Smith College / CSC212 / Assignment Starter Code

The [CSC212Examples](https://github.com/jjfiv/CSC212Examples) repository has all my examples from class. This has the bare-bones minimum you need to start an assignment.

## How to import this project into Eclipse

There are a lot of steps here! Don't try to memorize them. Whenever you click next, or open a menu, see if you can read it, guess what you should do next, and confirm with these steps. Doing it this way will help you get through it quicker for future assignments.

1. Go to the "File" menu and choose "Import"
2. Expand the Git Folder and choose "Projects from Git"
3. Click "Next"
4. Choose "Clone URI"
5. Copy and paste [https://github.com/jjfiv/CSC212Assignments.git](https://github.com/jjfiv/CSC212Assignments.git) into the URI field.
6. Click "Next"
7. Wait for it to find "master"
8. Click "Next"
9. (optional) Choose a directory to store the project.
10. Click "Next"
11. Choose "Import as general project"
12. Click "Next"
13. Click "Finish"
14. Right-Click on the new project that showed up in the "Package Explorer" on the left. Select "Configure > Convert to Maven Project".

## How to update this project in Eclipse

I will add examples here as I prepare for lectures throughout the Fall. When you import this repository, you will not have all the things I haven't built yet, but we can ask Eclipse to download my changes!

Right-Click on this project in Eclipse, then go to "Team" and choose "Pull" (close to top).

This should be all you need! If, for some reason, you and I have edited the same files, I can help you through the steps of either resetting your file ***or*** you can import a new copy of this repository.
